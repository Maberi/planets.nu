# planets.nu addons

## Ion Storm protection info
With this addon installed, it'll appear Ion Storm protection info on the "more details" window. The formula comes from Stefan Reuther's Page on ion storms: http://www.phost.de/~stefan/ion.html

## ~~Horwasp mining info~~ (obsolete)
This addon is obsolete. A much better one is **Horwasp corrections**, from Jezzarimu and Sibuna. You may find it at [Horwasp corrections](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/437766-horwasp-corrections).

## Cross beam transfer for v4
Allows a ship to beam from planet to foreign ship directly. If an own ship is on an own planets with other foreign ships on it, the addon will add a double horizontal
cross arrow at the bottom of the ship screen to open the cross beam transfer screen. In case more of one target is possible, a ship selector will be shown.
s for any foreing transfer, only one final target is allowed.

This addon is an adaptation of the **Cross beam** addon from Singularity that is working only up to v3 interface of Planets.nu.

This addon depends on [Fleet management](https://chmeee.org/ext/planets.nu/FleetManagement.user.js) addon from McNimble.
