# planets.nu addons

## Ion Storm protection info
With this addon installed, it'll appear Ion Storm protection info on the "more details" window. The formula comes from Stefan Reuther's Page on ion storms: http://www.phost.de/~stefan/ion.html

## Horwasp mining info
As of today, Planets.nu new UI (or mobile) doesn't give information about how much minerals are extracting horwarsp miners per turn. This addon solves this lack while it is not corrected in the Planets.nu original interface.
